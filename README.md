# Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital Community Training Institute Artificial Intelligence Chatbot

## Introduction
This project addresses the issue of visitors receiving delayed responses to their inquiries on the Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital (KWSH) Community Training Institute (CTI) website. By developing a Generative AI Chatbot, we aim to eliminate the need for human intervention for common questions while maintaining high visitor satisfaction, reducing labor costs, and streamlining the team's workload.

The chatbot will automatically address visitor inquiries and, for complex issues, route them to the relevant contact rather than generic contact details. Despite having no budget and limited resources, the project implements Large Language Models (LLMs), Live Chat Redirection, a User-Friendly Chatbot GUI, and an Admin Interface to provide an efficient solution.

### Key Results
A functional generative AI chatbot with a user-friendly interface.
Features like live chat redirection and admin capabilities for CRUD operations and performance monitoring.
Ensures scalability for future enhancements.
